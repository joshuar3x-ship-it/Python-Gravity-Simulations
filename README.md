# Python-Gravity-Simulations
Allows a user to create, visualize and analyse Gravitational systems using real-world Masses, Seperation and Velocity

Modeling real world Newtonian Physics in pygame, great for A-Level physics syllabus and learning/teaching or experimenting:

the controls are included in the description but in case you miss it here they are:

Please Note, in the IDE you run this in, there must be a folder called "Images" and put the "Pause.png" and "Play.png" in that folder to allow the code to access the images. 
The code is modular and runs on any size screen, if it doesn't fit your screen, change only screen_height and screen_width variables to fit your screen, the code will do the rest and insure everything still fits.

Version 2 of the software is already being developed but feel free to modify and report bugs/issues
